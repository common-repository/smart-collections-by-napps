Create smart collections

== Description ==

Create our own smart collections, group products by their attributes, discounted price and creation time. 
Just create your collection and every product will join the corresponding collection automatically.
Start now, save time by using the Smart collections by *[NAPPS](https://www.napps.io)*.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP 5.6 or greater
* Wordpress 4.7.0 or greater
* WooCommerce 3.5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option — WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser.

To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”
In the search field type “Discount rules by NAPPS” then click “Search Plugins.”. When you find our plugin you can install it by clicking “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

Manual installation method requires downloading the WooCommerce plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.1 =

* Fix - Error when created timestamp on product returns null

= 1.0.0 =

* New - Initial release
